    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In an age where culinary diversity and dining out have become integral parts of our social fabric, choosing the perfect restaurant can be both exciting and overwhelming. With an abundance of dining options ranging from quaint bistros to exotic eateries, making a dining decision has never been more challenging.\n",
    "Traditional restaurant websites have long relied on filters based on amenities, location, or cuisine types, providing users with a plethora of options to sift through. However, as the restaurant industry evolves and culinary landscapes expand, the need for a more refined and personalized approach to restaurant discovery has become evident.\n",
    "Enter the era of restaurant recommendation systems—a technological marvel that goes beyond the mundane task of filtering restaurants based on their amenities. These systems leverage the power of data science, machine learning, and user preferences to deliver tailored dining suggestions that match your unique tastes and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world where time is precious and choices are abundant, restaurant recommendation systems offer an invaluable solution by enhancing the dining experience in ways that traditional filters simply cannot.\n",
    "This article delves into the world of restaurant recommendation systems, exploring their importance, functionality, and the transformative impact they have on the way we discover and enjoy culinary delights.\n",
    "We will unveil how these intelligent algorithms are reshaping the gastronomic landscape, catering to the ever-evolving preferences of diners and revolutionizing the art of restaurant selection. Join us on this journey as we unravel the magic of restaurant recommendation systems, offering a taste of the future of dining exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional restaurant search platforms rely on static filters that do not adapt to individual preferences, resulting in time-consuming and often frustrating experiences for diners who seek restaurants that align with their unique tastes.\n",
    "By prioritizing amenities over personalized recommendations, existing systems hinder the exploration of new culinary experiences and limit the potential for serendipitous discoveries that could enhance the dining experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop an interactive and user-friendly restaurant recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Objective\n",
    "To design and develop a user-friendly website that seamlessly integrates the advanced restaurant recommendation system, allowing users to access personalized dining suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify and analyze key factors that significantly influence restaurant ratings and user preferences, incorporating this knowledge into the recommendation system's algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a robust data collection and processing pipeline to continually update user data and restaurant information, ensuring the recommendation system remains dynamic and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metric of Success\n",
    "\n",
    "To consider our project successful, we aim to achieve high accuracy in classifying user sentiment, maintain a low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in predicting engagement, and offer insightful location-based analysis.\n"

    "\n",
    "We will collect Yelp review data, including text reviews, star ratings, and business information, from the [Yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), which is publicly available and contains a large number of reviews across various businesses and locations.Our plan involves obtaining a substantial sample of Yelp reviews spanning different business categories, locations, and star ratings. This data will serve as our training and evaluation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features include: \n",
    "**review_id:** A unique identifier for each review,\n",
    "\n",
    "**user_id:** A unique identifier for each user who submitted a review,\n",
    "\n",
    "**business_id:** A unique identifier for each business being reviewed,\n",
    "\n",
    "**stars:** The rating given by the user in terms of stars (e.g., 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0),\n",
    "\n",
    "**useful:** A count of how many users found the review useful,\n",
    "\n",
    "**funny:** A count of how many users found the review funny,\n",
    "\n",
    "**cool:** A count of how many users found the review cool,\n",
    "\n",
    "**text:** The actual text content of the review and\n",
    "\n",
    "**date:** The date and time when the review was submitted.Due to the dataset being large we have constricted it to 15,438 rows which should be enough for nlp modeling.\n",
